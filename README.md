## Transformers vs LSTMs for Electronic Trading

## Description
This project consists of jupyter notebooks containing implementations for transformer-based models applied to 1-day ahead and N-days ahead stock price prediction. The implementation of the baseline models used for comparison against the transformer-based models are also included.

## Installation
The libraries required to run the notebooks in this project are torch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and pytorch_lightning.
Run !pip install <library> in the notebook if your kernel does not have any of these libraries.

<!-- 
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. -->

## Authors and acknowledgment
